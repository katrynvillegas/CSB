<b>New Routines:</b><br>My life now as a college student is very different from my life when I was in High School. Back then, my dad usually drops me off to school and gives me Php200 for my baon each day. After class, I go home by myself. Traveling time usually takes around 10 minutes if there's no traffic. By the time I arrive, I go straight to the kitchen and eat dinner.. Then I go to my room, change my clothes and rest for a little bit before I do my homework. <br><br>Now that I'm a College student, I just walk to the university by myself. Since I live nearby DLS-CSB, it only takes me more or less 5 minutes going there. Before entering the campus, IDs must be presented. Then go to the assigned room written in the EAF. As for me, my assigned rooms are located at Duerr Hall. After the 1st class, we only have limited time of break. So I'd rather go to the next assigned room than go somewhere else. Nobody wants to enter the room late and get everybody stare at you.<br><br>This past few weeks of being in college, I would say that it is very different from high school. In High school, you can do petix everyday.. Life is easier when you're in High school. But now, there is only allotted time for petix, gimmick, etc. Well, that depends on the person/student. My only advice is know your limits and enjoy life. <br><br><br>

<b>New Relationship:</b><br><br>Out of millions of people here in Philippines, we are the only GDD students. I would say GD1T is one of my newest relationship. 2nd is that out of 40 students in block GD1T, 8 of them are girls.. Us 8 girls are the 2nd relationship. <br><br><br>

<b>New Assumtions: </b><br><br>This year, new set of friends, block mates professors and environment are new to me. This is not my first time transferring schools, but it is very hard adjusting yourself to the environment and to others. This is just the first starting weeks of being a frosh at DLS-CSB, but I hope that me and my block mates will get along well. Although we're only 8 girls in the block, I hope us girls will get along and hang-out to know each other. Also in block GD1T, I hope that we will be as one.
